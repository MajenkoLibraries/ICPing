ICPing
======

Input Capture Ping))) library for chipKIT
-----------------------------------------

The ICPing library uses the Input Capture modules of the PIC32
chips used on chipKIT compatible boards to accurately measure the
echo pulse provided by a cheap 4-pin ultrasound range finder, such
as the HC-SR04 commonly available on eBay.

It has a free-running mode avaliable that will constantly measure
the current distance in the background with no blocking needed by 
your program.
